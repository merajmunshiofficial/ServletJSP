		The Servlet find the method of post or get by the method element.
		If nothing is mentioned default is Get
		With Get method the url?<Query string> is exposed, whereas in post the query string is not passed
		this is good for security
		so, in form we generally put the method as post
		and in Servlet we use doPost() instead of doGet()
